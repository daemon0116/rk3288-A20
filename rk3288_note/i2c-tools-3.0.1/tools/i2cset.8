.SH DESCRIPTION
i2cset is a small helper program to set registers visible through the I2C
bus.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -V
Display the version and exit.
.TP
.B -f
Force access to the device even if it is already busy. By default, i2cset
will refuse to access a device which is already under the control of a
kernel driver. Using this flag is dangerous, it can seriously confuse the
kernel driver in question. It can also cause i2cset to silently write to
the wrong register. So use at your own risk and only if you know what
you're doing.
.TP
.B -y
Disable interactive mode. By default, i2cset will wait for a confirmation
from the user before messing with the I2C bus. When this flag is used, it
will perform the operation directly. This is mainly meant to be used in
scripts.
.PP
There are four required options to i2cset. \fIi2cbus\fR indicates the number
of the I2C bus to be scanned.  This number should correspond to one of
the busses listed by \fIi2cdetect -l\fR. \fIchip-address\fR specifies the
address of the chip on that bus, and is an integer between 0x00 and 0x7F.
\fIdata-address\fR specifies the address on that chip to write to, and is an
integer between 0x00 and 0xFF. \fIvalue\fR is the value to write to that
location on the chip.
.PP
The \fImode\fR parameter, if specified, is one of the letters \fBb\fP or
\fBw\fP, corresponding to a write size of a single byte or a 16-bit word,
respectively. A \fBp\fP can also be appended to the \fImode\fR parameter to
enable PEC. If the \fImode\fR parameter is omitted, i2cset defaults to byte
mode without PEC. The \fIvalue\fR provided must be within range for the
specified data type (0x00-0xFF for bytes, 0x0000-0xFFFF for words).
.PP
The \fImask\fR parameter, if specified, describes which bits of \fIvalue\fR
will be actually written to \fIdata-address\fR. Bits set to 1 in the mask
are taken from \fIvalue\fR, while bits set to 0 will be read from
\fIdata-address\fR and thus preserved by the operation.

.SH WARNING
i2cset can be extremely dangerous if used improperly. It can confuse your
I2C bus, cause data loss, or have more serious side effects. Writing to
a serial EEPROM on a memory DIMM (chip addresses between 0x50 and 0x57) may
DESTROY your memory, leaving your system unbootable!  Be extremely careful
using this program.
